# sane [WIP]

A package manager for sane configurations

## apply package list

`sane` supports aliasing. By pulling a list of aliases, one doesn't need to type out the full name of the repo.

```bash
sane apply Azer0s/config/index
```

## apply settings

```bash
sane apply vimsettings
```

## start docker containers

```bash
sane start kafka
```
